# Deploying a Smart Contract on Klaytn using the Fee Delegation Mechanism

This repository provides an example of how to deploy a smart contract on the Klaytn blockchain using the fee delegation mechanism with `caver-js`.

## Overview

Fee delegation in Klaytn allows a third party (fee payer) to cover the transaction fees instead of the sender. This can enhance the user experience by removing the need for users to hold KLAY for transaction fees.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- `caver-js` library
- Klaytn account for the sender and fee payer
